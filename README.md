# Custom-Query-Language
This project aims to design, develop, and demonstrate a custom database system that offers efficiency and user-friendliness. The database system will support a relational (like MySQL) data model and introduce a unique query language for intuitive data manipulation.

The custom query language will be designed with keeping simplicity in mind. Clear and comprehensive documentation will accompany the language, facilitating user understanding and proficiency.

This project is a part of the course DSCI 551 - Foundations of Data Management, instructed by Prof. Wensheng Wu at the University of Southern California
